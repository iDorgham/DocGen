# DocGen CLI MVP ready for production (2025-09-19 09:23Z)

_**User (2025-09-19 08:57Z)**_

The DocGen CLI MVP is now complete and ready for production use! show me

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you showcase the completed DocGen CLI MVP! Let me first gather information about the current state of the project and then demonstrate its capabilities.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI MVP completion status features capabilities

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Now let me check the current project structure and demonstrate the CLI capabilities:


---

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen && python -m cli.main --help
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ cd /mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen && python -m cli.main --help
Command 'python' not found, did you mean:
  command 'python3' from deb python3
  command 'python' from deb python-is-python3

```

Let me try with python3 and also check the virtual environment:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python --version
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python --version
-bash: venv/bin/activate: No such file or directory
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -m cli.main --help
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python -m cli.main --help
-bash: venv/bin/activate: No such file or directory
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

Let me check the virtual environment structure and try a different approach:


---

```bash
ls -la venv/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ ls -la venv/

dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

Now let me try to activate the virtual environment and run the CLI:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate

Let me check the virtual environment structure more carefully and try to run it directly:

I need to install the dependencies first. Let me install them and then demonstrate the CLI:


---

```bash
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
-bash: ./venv/bin/pip: No such file or directory
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

---

Let me check what's available in the venv and install dependencies using python3 directly:


---

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz

    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with

    brew install pipx

    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.

    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally      
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf        
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.      

    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>     

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Let me create a proper virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_new
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ python3 -m venv venv_new

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.
