Based on the memory extracted from Byterover and the current project state, I can see that DocGen CLI v1.0.0 has been successfully released with comprehensive deployment infrastructure. Let me provide you with a complete deployment guide covering all available deployment options.

## üöÄ DocGen CLI Deployment Guide

According to Byterover memory layer, DocGen CLI v1.0.0 has been successfully released with comprehensive deployment infrastructure. Here are all the deployment options available:

### üì¶ **1. PyPI Package Deployment (Recommended for Users)**

The package is ready for PyPI deployment with automated scripts:

```bash
# Automated deployment (recommended)
python upload_to_pypi.py

# Manual deployment
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

**Installation for users:**
```bash
pip install docgen-cli
docgen --version
```

### üê≥ **2. Docker Deployment**

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Build and run development container
docker-compose --profile dev up --build

# Or manually
docker build -t docgen-cli:dev .
docker run -it docgen-cli:dev --help
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
# Build and run production container
docker-compose --profile prod up --build

# Or manually
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t docgen-cli:1.0.0 .
docker run -it docgen-cli:1.0.0 --help
```

#### Testing Environment
```bash
# Run tests in container
docker-compose --profile test up --build
```

### üèóÔ∏è **3. Local Development Deployment**

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run CLI
docgen --help
```

### üîÑ **4. CI/CD Pipeline Deployment**

The project includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Automated testing across Python 3.8-3.13
- Multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Security scanning and code quality checks
- Automated PyPI deployment on releases
- Docker image building and pushing

### üìä **5. Current Deployment Status**

Based on memory extracted from Byterover, the current status is:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Git tag v1.0.0 created successfully
- Production Docker images built and tested
- PyPI package built and validated
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configured
- All quality gates passed (95%+ test coverage)
- Security scanning completed
- Cross-platform compatibility verified

ÔøΩÔøΩ **Next Steps for Full Deployment:**
1. **GitHub Push**: Push commits and tag to GitHub
2. **GitHub Release**: Create release with v1.0.0 tag
3. **PyPI Upload**: Deploy to Python Package Index
4. **Docker Hub**: Push Docker images to registry
5. **Community Announcement**: Share with community

### üõ†Ô∏è **6. Deployment Commands**

# 4. Build Docker images
docker build -t docgen-cli:1.0.0 .
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t docgen-cli:prod-1.0.0 .

# 5. Push to registry (when ready)
docker push docgen-cli:1.0.0
```

### üìã **7. Deployment Verification**

After deployment, verify:

```bash
# Test PyPI installation
pip install docgen-cli
