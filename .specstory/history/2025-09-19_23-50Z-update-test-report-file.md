*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.
