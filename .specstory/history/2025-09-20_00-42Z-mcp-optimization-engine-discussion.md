*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-list-modules: List and filter modules in the codebase with optional keyword filtering.
    
**Purpose**: Get an overview of stored modules for navigation and reference, with project-focused filtering.
**Filtering**: Supports fuzzy keyword matching (case-insensitive, substring, word-based) against module names.
**Recommended**: Use your current repository name as keyword to focus on project-specific modules (e.g., "byterover").
**Module Format**: Modules follow <repo_name>_<module_name> convention, making repo-based filtering highly effective.
**Required**: You MUST call this tool first to understand the codebase and know which modules already exist before creating/search/updating modules.

*Parameters*:
  * keyword: docgen

*Result*:
**Filtered Modules matching "docgen" (6 total):**

- **docgen_cli_core**: Core functionality module for DocGen CLI including document generation, project management, validation, and error handling
- **docgen_cli_interface**: CLI interface module providing Click-based command structure with Rich formatting and interactive user experience
- **docgen_cli_mcp**: Enhanced MCP server integration module with comprehensive knowledge management and project planning capabilities

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-active-plans: List and filter incomplete plans for context recovery with enhanced task position display.
    
**Purpose**: Retrieve active (incomplete) plans to restore context between coding sessions.
**Use Cases**: 
- Session recovery, context restoration, plan continuation
- Fallback tool when byterover-update-plan-progress fails due to incorrect task names/positions
- Get accurate task positions for reliable progress updates
**IMPORTANT** Make sure you provide COMPLETELY ACCURATE module names as filtering. Otherwise, DO NOT PROVIDE ANY RELEVENT MODULE NAMES.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: MCP Optimization Engine Implementation

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.
