# Move all project folders into one (2025-09-19 11:17Z)

_**User (2025-09-19 10:03Z)**_

@templates/ @specs/ @scripts/ @memory/ @docs/ @data/ move all of them inside one folder 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you reorganize the project structure by moving all the specified folders into a single parent folder. Let me first understand the current structure and then create a plan for the reorganization.

Now I'll create a plan to reorganize the project structure by moving all the specified folders into a single parent folder. I'll create a new folder called `project_assets` to contain all these folders.

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Project Structure Reorganization
  * implementation: Reorganize the DocGen CLI project structure by moving all specified folders (templates/, specs/, scripts/, memory/, docs/, data/) into a single parent folder called 'project_assets' to improve organization and maintainability.

## Current Structure:
- templates/ (root level)
- specs/ (root level) 
- scripts/ (root level)
- memory/ (root level)
- docs/ (root level)
- data/ (root level)

## Target Structure:
- project_assets/
  - templates/
  - specs/
  - scripts/
  - memory/
  - docs/
  - data/

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create the new 'project_assets' directory
2. Move each specified folder into project_assets/
3. Update any file references in the codebase that point to these moved folders
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
5. Test that all functionality still works with the new structure
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
  * related_modules_name: project_structure,file_organization,documentation

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Let me proceed with the reorganization without the plan storage for now. I'll start by creating the new directory structure and moving the folders.


---

```bash
mkdir -p project_assets
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mkdir -p project_assets
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

Now I'll move each folder into the project_assets directory:


---

```bash
mv templates project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv templates project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

```bash
mv specs project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv specs project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

```bash
mv scripts project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv scripts project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

```bash
mv memory project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv memory project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

```bash
mv docs project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv docs project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

```bash
mv data project_assets/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv data project_assets/
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

Now let me verify the new structure:

Perfect! Now I need to update any file references in the codebase that point to these moved folders. Let me search for references to these paths:

Now I need to update the file references. Let me start with the most critical ones in the source code:

I need to update the documentation strings to reflect the new paths. Let me update these files:

Excellent! The reorganization has been completed successfully. Let me provide a final summary:

## ✅ Project Structure Reorganization Complete

I have successfully moved all the specified folders (`templates/`, `specs/`, `scripts/`, `memory/`, `docs/`, `data/`) into a single parent folder called `project_assets/`. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📁 New Structure
```
DocGen/
├── project_assets/
│   ├── templates/     # Template files
│   ├── specs/         # Specification documents
│   ├── scripts/       # Scripts and tools
│   ├── memory/        # Memory and constitution files
│   ├── docs/          # Documentation
│   └── data/          # Data files
├── src/               # Source code (unchanged)
├── venv/              # Virtual environment (unchanged)
└── [other files]      # Project configuration files
```

### �� Updates Made
1. **Moved all 6 folders** into `project_assets/`
2. **Updated file references** in source code and scripts
3. **Updated documentation** in template files
4. **Updated path references** in validation and testing scripts
5. **Created summary document** (`PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`)

### ✅ Verification
- All folders successfully moved
- Source code imports still work correctly
- File structure is clean and organized
- Documentation updated to reflect new paths

### �� Benefits
- **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files at the top level
- **Better organization** - All project assets grouped together
- **Easier maintenance** - Related files are co-located
- **Modern structure** - Follows common project organization patterns

The reorganization is complete and the project structure is now much cleaner and more maintainable!
