*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.

*Parameters*:
  * messages: DocGen CLI Project Overview: A Python CLI tool for generating project documentation from specifications using spec-driven development. Built with Click, Jinja2, Rich, and Pydantic.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Knowledge Management Setup
  * implementation: ## Knowledge Management and Project Planning Setup for DocGen CLI

### Overview
Set up comprehensive knowledge management and project planning infrastructure using Byterover MCP server integration. This includes establishing persistent knowledge storage, project planning workflows, and automated context management.

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Knowledge Infrastructure Setup**: Establish persistent knowledge storage patterns
2. **Project Planning Framework**: Create structured planning and tracking workflows  
3. **Context Management**: Implement automated context assessment and reflection
4. **Module Documentation**: Enhance existing module documentation with insights
5. **Workflow Integration**: Integrate knowledge management into development workflows

### Technical Approach
- Leverage Byterover MCP server for persistent knowledge storage
- Use existing module structure as foundation for knowledge organization
- Implement automated knowledge retrieval and storage patterns
- Create project planning templates and workflows
- Establish quality gates for knowledge management
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
