Now let me create a comprehensive plan to enhance the developer experience for the DocGen CLI project:


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Enhanced Developer Experience
  * implementation: ## Enhanced Developer Experience Implementation Plan

### Overview
This plan focuses on significantly improving the developer experience for the DocGen CLI project by enhancing the CLI interface, error handling, documentation, and user workflows.

### Key Areas of Enhancement

#### 1. Professional CLI Interface with Click
- **Rich Terminal Formatting**: Enhanced visual output with better colors, icons, and formatting
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars and status updates for long-running operations
- **Interactive Prompts**: Smart prompts with validation, suggestions, and auto-completion
- **Command Help System**: Comprehensive help with examples, tips, and cross-references

#### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery
- **Enhanced Error Hierarchy**: More specific error types with actionable suggestions
- **Automatic Recovery**: Smart error recovery mechanisms for common issues
- **Error Context**: Detailed error context with troubleshooting steps
- **Error Reporting**: Built-in error reporting and analytics

#### 3. Interactive Prompts and Guided Workflows
- **Wizard Mode**: Step-by-step guided workflows for complex operations
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent default values based on context and history
- **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Workflow Templates**: Predefined workflows for common use cases

#### 4. Extensive Documentation and Examples
- **Interactive Help**: Context-aware help system with examples
- **Command Examples**: Rich examples for every command with explanations
- **Tutorial Mode**: Built-in tutorials and guided learning
- **Best Practices**: Integrated best practices and recommendations

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Enhanced CLI Interface and Error Handling
2. **Phase 2**: Interactive Workflows and Smart Prompts
3. **Phase 3**: Documentation and Examples Enhancement
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced Features and Analytics

### Success Criteria
- 90%+ user satisfaction with CLI experience
- Reduced time to complete common tasks by 50%
- Comprehensive error recovery for 80% of common issues
- Complete documentation coverage with examples
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
  * related_modules_name: cli,error_handler,validation,documentation

*Result*:
Plan "Enhanced Developer Experience" saved successfully with 10 tasks

Now let me start implementing the enhanced developer experience. First, I'll enhance the CLI interface with better formatting and progress indicators:


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-update-plan-progress: Update plan progress and mark tasks or entire plans as completed using position-based task identification.
    **IMPORTANT**: If this tool fails, YOU MUST call byterover-retrieve-active-plans with the EXACT plan_name to get the correct task info.
    **IMPORTANT**: You are highly recommended to use by_task_position to identify the task to be updated over by_task_name.
    **Purpose**: Track implementation progress and mark tasks/plans as completed.
    **Use Cases**:
    - Task completion updates: Provide plan_name and by_task_position (recommended) or by_task_name
    - Plan completion updates: Provide ONLY plan_name (omit task identifiers)
    - Progress tracking with enhanced remaining tasks visibility

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Enhanced Developer Experience
  * by_task_position: 1
  * is_completed: true

*Result*:
✅ **Success**: Progress updated for task #1. 9 tasks remaining.

📋 **Remaining Tasks (9):**
2. Rich Terminal Formatting
3. Progress Indicators
4. Interactive Prompts
5. Comprehensive Error Handling
6. Error Recovery Mechanisms
7. Guided Workflows
8. Documentation Enhancement
9. Examples and Tutorials
10. Testing and Validation
</details>

    **IMPORTANT**: If this tool fails, YOU MUST call byterover-retrieve-active-plans with the EXACT plan_name to get the correct task info.
    **IMPORTANT**: You are highly recommended to use by_task_position to identify the task to be updated over by_task_name.
    **Purpose**: Track implementation progress and mark tasks/plans as completed.
    **Use Cases**:
    - Task completion updates: Provide plan_name and by_task_position (recommended) or by_task_name
    - Plan completion updates: Provide ONLY plan_name (omit task identifiers)
    - Progress tracking with enhanced remaining tasks visibility

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Enhanced Developer Experience
  * by_task_position: 2
  * is_completed: true

*Result*:
✅ **Success**: Progress updated for task #2. 8 tasks remaining.

📋 **Remaining Tasks (8):**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.

Now let me store the knowledge about the new CLI commands:

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.
