_**Assistant**_

I'll help you understand the current status of these functional requirements (FR-02 through FR-05) in the DocGen CLI project. Let me first retrieve knowledge about the project's current state and then examine the relevant specifications and implementation.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI functional requirements FR-02 FR-03 FR-04 FR-05 validation error handling template customization MCP integration

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
