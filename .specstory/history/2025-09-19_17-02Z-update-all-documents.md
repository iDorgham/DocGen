Update all documents 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update all documents in the DocGen CLI project. Let me first retrieve knowledge about the current project state and then systematically update all documentation.


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI project documentation update requirements and current state
  * limit: 5

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
</details>

Let me start by examining the current project structure and documentation to understand what needs to be updated.

Now let me create a comprehensive plan to update all documents and then execute it systematically:


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Documentation Update Plan
  * implementation: Comprehensive update of all project documentation to reflect current state, recent achievements, and accurate project structure. This includes updating README.md, control panel files, specifications, developer documentation, and user guides to ensure consistency and accuracy across all documentation.
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
  * related_modules_name: documentation,specifications,control_panel,user_guides

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Let me proceed with updating all documents systematically. I'll start with the main README.md file:

@assets/ any file name has kiro change it to driven even inside the file 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you rename all files containing "kiro" to "driven" and update their content accordingly. Let me first search for all files with "kiro" in their names and content.


---



---

Let me search more specifically in the assets directory:


---



---

Now let me search for files with "kiro" in their filenames:


---



---

Perfect! I found 2 files with "kiro" in their names. Let me also check for any content containing "kiro" in these files:


---

Read file: undefined

---

Read file: undefined

---

Now I'll rename both files and update their content to replace "kiro" with "driven":


---

```bash
cd assets/docs/developer && mv kiro-workflow-integration.md driven-workflow-integration.md
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ cd assets/docs/developer && mv kiro-workflow-integration.md driven-workflow-integration.md
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/assets/docs/developer$ 
```

---

```bash
cd assets/reports && mv kiro-workflow-integration-summary.md driven-workflow-integration-summary.md
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/assets/docs/developer$ cd assets/reports && mv kiro-workflow-integration-summary.md driven-workflow-integration-summary.md
-bash: cd: assets/reports: No such file or directory
