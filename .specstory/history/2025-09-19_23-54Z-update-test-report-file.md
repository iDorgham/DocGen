_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the TestSprite MCP test report. Let me first retrieve knowledge about the current project status and then update the report with the latest information.


---



---

I see there's a timeout issue with the Byterover knowledge retrieval. Let me check the current project status and gather information from the codebase to update the TestSprite report.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 3 and save it using the Byterover MCP tools:

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Phase 3 Driven Workflow
  * implementation: # Phase 3: Driven Workflow Integration Implementation Plan

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: spec-driven development validation system implementation patterns and best practices
  * limit: 3
