# Minor linting errors discussion (2025-09-19 16:21Z)

The linting errors shown are minor formatting issues (missing blank lines around headings) that don't affect functionality and can be addressed later if needed.

I understand you're referring to some linting errors that are minor formatting issues, specifically missing blank lines around headings. These are indeed cosmetic issues that don't affect the functionality of the code.

Let me check the current state of the project and see if there are any linting errors that need attention:

I can see there are indeed many linting errors, primarily related to markdown formatting issues like missing blank lines around headings, lists, and code blocks. As you mentioned, these are minor formatting issues that don't affect functionality.

You're absolutely right - these are cosmetic markdown linting issues that can be addressed later when there's time for cleanup. The main types of errors I see are:

1. **MD022**: Missing blank lines around headings
2. **MD032**: Missing blank lines around lists  
3. **MD031**: Missing blank lines around fenced code blocks
4. **MD040**: Missing language specification for code blocks
5. **MD012**: Multiple consecutive blank lines
6. **MD009**: Trailing spaces

These are all formatting/style issues that don't impact the actual functionality of the code or documentation. They're the kind of issues that can be easily fixed with automated tools or during a dedicated cleanup session.

Since you've indicated these can be addressed later, what would you like to work on next? The project structure reorganization and reference updates have been completed, so we could focus on:

1. **Core functionality development** - Working on the actual DocGen CLI features
2. **Testing and validation** - Setting up and running tests
3. **Documentation improvements** - Enhancing the existing documentation
4. **MCP integration** - Further developing the MCP server integrations
5. **Something else** - Any other aspect of the project you'd like to focus on

What would be most valuable to work on at this point?
