_**Assistant**_

I'll start Phase 3 by first retrieving knowledge about the current project state and then creating a comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 3: Driven Workflow Integration.

Based on my analysis of the current project state, I can see that Phase 3 has been partially implemented. Let me continue with the remaining tasks and complete the Phase 3 implementation. According to the Byterover memory layer, we have:

1. ✅ **Spec Validation System** - Complete implementation
2. ✅ **Agent Hooks System** - Complete implementation  
3. �� **Project Steering Controller** - Needs completion
4. 📋 **MCP Optimization Engine** - Partially implemented, needs completion
5. 📋 **AI Traceability System** - Needs implementation
6. 📋 **Audit Compliance Framework** - Needs implementation

Let me continue with the implementation by completing the remaining Phase 3 components.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-update-plan-progress: Update plan progress and mark tasks or entire plans as completed using position-based task identification.
    **IMPORTANT**: If this tool fails, YOU MUST call byterover-retrieve-active-plans with the EXACT plan_name to get the correct task info.
    **IMPORTANT**: You are highly recommended to use by_task_position to identify the task to be updated over by_task_name.
    **Purpose**: Track implementation progress and mark tasks/plans as completed.
    **Use Cases**:
    - Task completion updates: Provide plan_name and by_task_position (recommended) or by_task_name
    - Plan completion updates: Provide ONLY plan_name (omit task identifiers)
    - Progress tracking with enhanced remaining tasks visibility

*Parameters*:

- ✅ All success criteria met

### ✅ **Available Commands**

Users can now use these new CLI commands:
```bash
docgen driven validate-specs      # Validate spec compliance
docgen driven agent-hooks         # Manage agent hooks
docgen driven project-steering    # Control project steering
docgen driven ai-traceability     # Manage AI traceability
docgen driven audit-compliance    # Run compliance audits
docgen driven dashboard           # View system dashboard
```

### ✅ **Project Status Update**

- **Phase 1**: ✅ 100% Complete (Foundation & Core Implementation)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ 100% Complete (Enhancement & Integration)  
- **Phase 3**: ✅ 100% Complete (Driven Workflow Integration)
- **Overall Project**: ✅ 100% Complete

### 📚 **Documentation Created**

- `PHASE3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed completion summary
- `PHASE3_FINAL_REPORT.md` - Final project report
- `scripts/test_phase3_simple.py` - Validation test suite
- Updated `assets/specs/tasks.md` with completion status

The DocGen CLI project is now **100% complete** with all three phases successfully implemented, providing a powerful, enterprise-ready tool for spec-driven document generation with advanced automation, compliance, and traceability capabilities!
