dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/project_assets/scripts$ cd /mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen && find . -name "mcp_integration.py" -type f   
./project_assets/development/scripts/mcp_integration.py
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

I see the files were created in a different location. Let me move them to the correct location:


---

```bash
mv project_assets/development/scripts/*.py project_assets/scripts/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Files already in correct location or moved"
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ mv project_assets/development/scripts/*.py project_assets/scripts/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Files already in correct location or moved"
Files already in correct location or moved
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

---

Let me check what files are actually in the scripts directory and create a simple test:


---

```bash
ls -la project_assets/scripts/
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ ls -la project_assets/scripts/
ls: cannot access 'project_assets/scripts/': No such file or directory
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

---

Let me check the actual project structure:


---

```bash
find . -name "scripts" -type d
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ find . -name "scripts" -type d
./project_assets/development/scripts
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

I see the issue. The files were created in the wrong directory. Let me check the actual project structure and create the files in the correct location:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Perfect! I can see the files were created in `project_assets/development/scripts/`. Let me create a simple test to verify the MCP integration works:


---

```bash
cd project_assets/development/scripts && python3 -c "from mcp_integration import MCPIntegration; print('✅ MCP Integration module imported successfully')"
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ cd project_assets/development/scripts && python3 -c "from mcp_integration import MCPIntegration; print('✅ MCP Integration module imported successfully')"
✅ MCP Integration module imported successfully
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/project_assets/development/scripts$
```

---

Excellent! Now let me test the master integration:


---

```bash
cd project_assets/development/scripts && python3 -c "from mcp_master_integration import MCPMasterIntegration; print('✅ MCP Master Integration module imported successfully')"
```

```
t/scripts$ cd project_assets/development/scripts && python3 -c "from mcp_master_integration import MCPMasterIntegration; print('✅ MCP Master Integration module imported successfully')"
-bash: cd: project_assets/development/scripts: No such file or directory
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/project_assets/development/scripts$
```

---

```bash
python3 -c "from mcp_master_integration import MCPMasterIntegration; print('✅ MCP Master Integration module imported successfully')"
```

```
t/scripts$ python3 -c "from mcp_master_integration import MCPMasterIntegration; print('✅ MCP Master Integration module imported successfully')"
✅ MCP Master Integration module imported successfully
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/project_assets/development/scripts$
```

---

Perfect! Now let me create a simple demonstration script to show the MCP integration in action:

Now let me run the demo to show the MCP integration in action:


---

```bash
python3 demo_mcp_integration.py
```

```
