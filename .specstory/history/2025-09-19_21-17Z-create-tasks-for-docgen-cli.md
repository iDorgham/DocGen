_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create comprehensive tasks for DocGen CLI following the spec-driven development approach and inspired by the Kiro workflow. Let me first gather knowledge about the current project state and then create the tasks.


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI project current development status and task requirements
  * limit: 5

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
</details>

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-list-modules: List and filter modules in the codebase with optional keyword filtering.
    
**Purpose**: Get an overview of stored modules for navigation and reference, with project-focused filtering.
**Filtering**: Supports fuzzy keyword matching (case-insensitive, substring, word-based) against module names.
**Recommended**: Use your current repository name as keyword to focus on project-specific modules (e.g., "byterover").
**Module Format**: Modules follow <repo_name>_<module_name> convention, making repo-based filtering highly effective.
**Required**: You MUST call this tool first to understand the codebase and know which modules already exist before creating/search/updating modules.

*Parameters*:
  * keyword: docgen

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

I'll update the tasks to reflect the current status and ensure they align with the Driven workflow integration. Let me first retrieve knowledge about the current project status and then update the tasks accordingly.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI current project status and task progress
  * limit: 5

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations
**IMPORTANT** During any task or plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO **FREQUENTLY** use this tool to store new programming knowledge in the project
**ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for storage purposes.
