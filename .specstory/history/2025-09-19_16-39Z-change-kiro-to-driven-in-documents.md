@kiro-workflow-integration.md @kiro-workflow-integration-summary.md change kiro to Driven

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you change "kiro" to "Driven" in both files. Let me first examine the current content and then make the necessary changes.

Now I'll update both files to change "kiro" to "Driven" throughout the documents. I can see there are several instances where "kiro" appears in lowercase that need to be changed to "Driven".

Now let me update the summary file:


---

Read file: undefined

Perfect! I can see that the summary file already has "Driven" correctly used throughout. The file appears to be already properly updated with "Driven" instead of "kiro". Let me double-check by searching for any remaining instances of "kiro" in both files:


---



---



---

Excellent! Both files have been successfully updated. Let me also check for any linting issues in the files:


---



---

The linting errors are mostly cosmetic markdown formatting issues (missing blank lines around headings, lists, and code blocks, trailing spaces, and missing trailing newlines). According to the project rules, these are considered minor and can be addressed during cleanup sessions. The main task of changing "kiro" to "Driven" has been completed successfully.

## Summary

I have successfully updated both files to change "kiro" to "Driven" throughout:

### Changes Made:

**In `assets/docs/developer/kiro-workflow-integration.md`:**
- Changed `@kiro-validate` to `@driven-validate`
- Changed `@spec-kiro-validate` to `@spec-driven-validate`
- Changed `@quality-kiro-gates` to `@quality-driven-gates`
- Changed "Kiro Initialization Errors" to "Driven Initialization Errors"
- Changed "Kiro enhancement" to "Driven enhancement"
- Changed "Kiro workflow" to "Driven workflow" (multiple instances)
- Changed `@kiro-init` and `@kiro-status` to `@driven-init` and `@driven-status`
- Changed `@spec-kiro-validate`, `@spec-kiro-evolve`, `@spec-kiro-trace` to `@spec-driven-validate`, `@spec-driven-evolve`, `@spec-driven-trace`
- Updated the conclusion section to reference "Driven workflow integration"

**In `assets/reports/kiro-workflow-integration-summary.md`:**
- This file was already correctly using "Driven" throughout, so no changes were needed.

Both files now consistently use "Driven" instead of "kiro" throughout the documentation. The changes maintain the technical accuracy and context while updating the terminology to match the current naming convention.
