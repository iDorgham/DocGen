I'll help you get started with the DocGen CLI project. Let me first check the current state and retrieve any relevant knowledge from the Byterover memory layer.

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.
