Testing Enhancement: Implement comprehensive test coverage to meet the 80% requirement

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement comprehensive test coverage to meet the 80% requirement for the DocGen CLI project. Let me start by analyzing the current project structure and existing tests, then create a comprehensive testing strategy.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: testing requirements 80% coverage DocGen CLI project test structure

Now I'll create a comprehensive testing implementation plan to meet the 80% coverage requirement. Let me first save this plan and then implement it.


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Comprehensive Test Coverage Implementation
  * implementation: Implement comprehensive test coverage to meet the 80% requirement for DocGen CLI project. This includes:

1. **Test Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Create tests/ directory structure
   - Configure pytest with coverage reporting
   - Set up test fixtures and utilities
   - Configure test data and mock objects

2. **Unit Test Implementation**:
   - Test all core modules (commands, core, models, utils)
   - Test CLI interface and command handlers
   - Test template management and rendering
   - Test validation and error handling
   - Test file I/O operations

3. **Integration Test Implementation**:
   - Test complete document generation workflows
   - Test project management operations
   - Test template system integration
   - Test error recovery mechanisms

4. **Test Coverage Validation**:
   - Achieve >80% code coverage
   - Validate all critical paths are tested
   - Ensure error scenarios are covered
   - Verify performance requirements

5. **Quality Gates Integration**:
   - Integrate with MCP testing tools
   - Set up automated test execution
   - Configure coverage reporting
   - Implement test result storage
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
  * related_modules_name: src/commands,src/core,src/models,src/utils,src/cli

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
