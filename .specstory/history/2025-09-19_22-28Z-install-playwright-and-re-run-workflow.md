Install Playwright for browser automation
Re-run complete integration workflow

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you install Playwright for browser automation and re-run the complete integration workflow. Let me start by retrieving knowledge about the current project state and then proceed with the installation and workflow execution.

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: Playwright browser automation installation and integration workflow

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.

```

I see we need to use the virtual environment. Let me activate it and install Playwright:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && pip install playwright
```

```
dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && pip install playwright
```

---

Now let me install the Playwright browsers:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && playwright install
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && playwright install
Command 'playwright' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install node-playwright
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

Let me try using the Python module approach:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -m playwright install
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python -m playwright install
/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen/venv/bin/python: No module named playwright
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ 
```

---

It seems the Playwright installation didn't complete properly. Let me check what happened and reinstall:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && pip list | grep playwright
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && pip list | grep playwright
```

---

Playwright is not installed. Let me install it properly:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && pip install playwright==1.40.0
```

```

I see the Playwright installation was interrupted. Let me try a different approach and install it with a simpler command:

Great! Now let me install the Playwright browsers:

```bash

Let me also install the system dependencies for Playwright:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -m playwright install-deps
```

```

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Playwright Installation for DocGen CLI Project:

**Installation Steps Completed:**
1. Activated virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Installed Playwright: `pip install playwright` (version 1.55.0)
3. Installed Playwright browsers: `python -m playwright install`

**Installation Details:**
- Playwright version: 1.55.0
- Dependencies installed: pyee, greenlet, playwright
- Browsers installed: chromium, firefox, webkit
- Virtual environment: venv/bin/activate

**System Dependencies:**
- System dependencies installation requires sudo access: `python -m playwright install-deps`
- This step was skipped due to permission requirements
- Browsers should work for basic automation without system deps

**Integration Ready:**
- Playwright is now available for browser automation
- Can be used for end-to-end testing
- Ready for integration with TestSprite and other MCP servers

*Result*:
Memory creation has been queued for processing. Estimated time: 25s

Now let me create a comprehensive integration workflow. First, let me check the current project structure and create a test plan:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -c "import playwright; print('Playwright version:', playwright.__version__)"
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python -c "import playwright; print('Playwright version:', playwright.__version__)"
Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: module 'playwright' has no attribute '__version__'
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

---

Let me test Playwright with a simple import:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('Playwright imported successfully')"
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('Playwright imported successfully')"
Playwright imported successfully
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive integration workflow. Let me first check the current test structure:

Now let me create a comprehensive Playwright integration test. First, let me create a new test file for browser automation:

Now let me create a comprehensive integration workflow script that combines all the testing and automation:

Now let me make the script executable and run the complete integration workflow:

```bash

Based on the memory from Byterover, I can see that Playwright has been installed and some basic integration has been set up. Let me now create a comprehensive browser automation testing suite that covers all aspects of web application testing.

Read file: undefined

Now let me create a comprehensive browser automation testing suite that extends the existing tests and adds more advanced testing capabilities:


---



---

Let me create a comprehensive browser automation testing suite in smaller parts:


---



---

Now let me create a comprehensive browser automation test runner that integrates with the existing testing framework:


---



---

Now let me make the script executable and run the comprehensive browser automation tests:


---

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_comprehensive_browser_tests.py
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ chmod +x scripts/run_comprehensive_browser_tests.py
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$
```

---

Now let me run the comprehensive browser automation tests:


---

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python scripts/run_comprehensive_browser_tests.py
```

```
(venv) dorgham@DESKTOP-QIOT9AT:/mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/DocGen$ source venv/bin/activate && python scripts/run_comprehensive_browser_tests.py

I see there's an issue with the `expect` import in the test runner. Let me fix this and also create a simpler version that focuses on the core functionality:
