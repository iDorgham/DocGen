    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

Based on my analysis of the DocGen CLI project and the knowledge retrieved from Byterover memory layer, I can see that the project has completed all development phases and is ready for production deployment. Let me create a comprehensive production deployment plan.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-save-implementation-plan: Save structured implementation plans with todo lists and codebase context.
    **IMPORTANT**: YOU MUST use this tool before ANY implementation plan. YOU CANNOT start your implementation if the plan IS NOT SAVED YET!
    **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the plan_name and task_name are CONCISE (five words at maximum)!
    **Purpose**: Store persistent implementation plans to prevent context loss between coding sessions.
    **Use Cases**: Complex features, multi-step implementations, cross-session continuity.

*Parameters*:
  * plan_name: Production Deployment Setup
  * implementation: # DocGen CLI Production Deployment Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements a comprehensive production deployment strategy for DocGen CLI, including CI/CD pipeline, containerization, package distribution, and monitoring infrastructure.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Package Distribution**: PyPI package with proper versioning
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Documentation**: Production deployment guides and API documentation

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Package Preparation**: Optimize package structure and dependencies
2. **Containerization**: Create Docker images for different deployment scenarios
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing, building, and deployment
4. **Distribution**: Configure PyPI publishing and version management
5. **Monitoring**: Implement health checks and performance metrics
6. **Documentation**: Create production deployment guides

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass (80%+ coverage)
- Security scans must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Documentation must be complete
- Package must be installable from PyPI
  * todo_items: [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
  * related_modules_name: docgen_cli_core,docgen_cli_deployment,docgen_cli_monitoring

    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
