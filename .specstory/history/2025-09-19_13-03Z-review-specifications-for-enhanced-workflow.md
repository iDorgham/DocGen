<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **IMPORTANT** When implementing any task in a plan, YOU ARE REQUIRED to use this tool FREQUENTLY to get critical knowledge and insights to correctly carry out the task.
    **ADDITIONAL** You are also highly recommended to use this tool outside the two main workflows for retrieval purposes.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

*Parameters*:
  * query: DocGen CLI enhanced workflow specifications and MCP integration patterns
  * limit: 5

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Based on my comprehensive review of the specifications, I can now provide you with a detailed understanding of the enhanced workflow for the DocGen CLI project. Here's what I've discovered:

## Enhanced Workflow Overview

The DocGen CLI project implements a sophisticated **spec-driven development workflow** with comprehensive **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration** that enhances productivity, quality assurance, and knowledge management.

### üéØ **Core Workflow Principles**

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All development starts from specifications before code generation
2. **Knowledge-First Approach**: MCP servers provide context-aware development
3. **Quality-First**: Comprehensive testing and validation at every step
4. **Automated Workflows**: Extensive automation for consistency and efficiency

### üîÑ **Development Phases**

The workflow is organized into structured phases:

#### **Phase 1: Project Initialization** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Core CLI structure with Click framework
- Project management commands (create, switch, status, recent)
- Document generation with Jinja2 templates
- Validation system and error handling

#### **Phase 2: Enhancement and Integration** üîÑ IN PROGRESS (60%)
- **MCP Integration**: 6 MCP servers for enhanced development
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation suite

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** ‚è≥ PLANNED
- Advanced template system
- Git integration
- Plugin architecture

### ÔøΩÔøΩ **MCP Server Integration**

The enhanced workflow integrates **6 MCP servers** for comprehensive development support:

#### **1. Byterover MCP** - Knowledge Management
- **Purpose**: Persistent knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Functions**: 
  - `byterover-retrieve-knowledge()` - Get context before tasks
  - `byterover-store-knowledge()` - Save implementation patterns
  - `byterover-save-implementation-plan()` - Track development plans
  - `byterover-update-module()` - Document codebase modules

#### **2. TestSprite MCP** - Automated Testing
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive test generation and execution
- **Functions**:
  - `testsprite-bootstrap-tests()` - Initialize testing environment
  - `testsprite-generate-test-plan()` - Create test strategies
  - `testsprite-generate-code-and-execute()` - Run automated tests

#### **3. Context7 MCP** - Library Documentation
- **Purpose**: Access to library documentation and best practices
- **Functions**:
  - `context7-resolve-library-id()` - Resolve library names
  - `context7-get-library-docs()` - Get comprehensive documentation

#### **4. Browser Tools MCP** - Quality Audits
- **Purpose**: Real-time quality validation and debugging
- **Functions**:
  - `browser-tools-runAccessibilityAudit()` - Accessibility validation
  - `browser-tools-runPerformanceAudit()` - Performance testing
  - `browser-tools-runBestPracticesAudit()` - Code quality checks

#### **5. Playwright MCP** - Browser Automation
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing and user journey validation
- **Functions**:
  - `playwright-browser-navigate()` - Browser automation
  - `playwright-browser-snapshot()` - Accessibility tree capture
  - `playwright-browser-take-screenshot()` - Visual validation

#### **6. Dart MCP** - Project Management
- **Purpose**: Task and documentation management
- **Functions**:
  - `dart-create-task()` - Task creation and tracking
  - `dart-create-doc()` - Documentation management
  - `dart-list-tasks()` - Progress monitoring

### üìã **Daily Development Workflow**

#### **Morning Setup**
```yaml
1. byterover-retrieve-knowledge("DocGen CLI current development status")
2. dart-list-tasks (view current priorities)
3. context7-get-library-docs (for libraries to be used)
4. Review project status and plan day's work
```

#### **During Development**
```yaml
Before Each Task:
  - byterover-retrieve-knowledge (task-specific context)
  - context7-resolve-library-id (required libraries)
  - context7-get-library-docs (library documentation)

While Coding:
  - Access library documentation as needed
  - Follow coding standards and patterns
  - Implement comprehensive error handling

After Each Feature:
  - byterover-store-knowledge (implementation details)
  - byterover-update-module (if module changes)
  - Run relevant tests
```

#### **End of Day**
```yaml
1. byterover-store-knowledge (day's learnings and implementations)
2. dart-update-task (mark completed tasks)
3. testsprite-generate-code-and-execute (run tests)
4. browser-tools-runAuditMode (quality validation)
5. Plan next day's priorities
```

### üéØ **Quality Gates**

The enhanced workflow includes comprehensive quality gates:

#### **Pre-Commit Gates**
- Code formatting validation (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Test execution and coverage validation
- Security vulnerability scans
- Documentation completeness checks

#### **Pre-Deployment Gates**
- Full test suite execution
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Accessibility compliance

#### **Continuous Gates**
- Real-time quality monitoring
- Automated quality checks
- Performance regression detection
- Knowledge management validation

### üìä **Current Project Status**

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: ‚úÖ **100% Complete** - All core features working
- **Phase 2 (Enhancement)**: üîÑ **60% Complete** - MCP integration in progress
- **Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ **85%** (target: 80%)
- **Performance**: ‚úÖ **All operations < 5 seconds**
- **MCP Integration**: üîÑ **60% complete** (target: 100%)

### üöÄ **Key Benefits of Enhanced Workflow**

1. **50% faster development** with context-aware coding
2. **90% reduction** in documentation lookup time
3. **100% automated** test coverage tracking
4. **80% reduction** in bug discovery time
5. **Real-time quality audits** on every change
6. **Persistent knowledge base** for team collaboration

### üìà **Success Metrics**

- **Test Coverage**: > 80% (currently 85%)
