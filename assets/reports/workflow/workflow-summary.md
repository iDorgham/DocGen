# DocGen CLI Development Workflow Summary

## Executive Summary

The DocGen CLI project follows a **spec-driven development approach** with a comprehensive workflow that ensures quality, traceability, and maintainability. The project has undergone significant reorganization and refactoring to establish a clean, modular architecture.

## Current Project State

### ‚úÖ Completed Work
1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Consolidated files into `assets/` directory
   - Established clean, spec-driven development structure
   - Created comprehensive documentation framework

2. **CLI Architecture Refactoring**
   - Refactored monolithic `src/cli/main.py` into modular command structure
   - Created `src/cli/commands/` directory with separate modules
   - Implemented proper command grouping and organization

3. **Import Dependencies Fix**
   - Fixed incorrect import paths in test files
   - Consolidated duplicate `error_handler.py` files
   - Established proper module structure and dependencies

### üîÑ Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Implementation
- **Progress**: 15% (3 of 20 tasks completed)
- **Target Completion**: October 24, 2025
- **Focus**: Core functionality and basic features

## Development Workflow Overview

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Process
```
Spec Review ‚Üí Task Selection ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí Spec Sync
```

**Key Principles:**
- Always start with specifications before writing code
- Every feature must map to a requirement (FR-XX or NFR-XX)
- Technical decisions must align with architecture in `tech.md`
- Tasks must follow the development plan in `tasks.md`

### 2. Quality Gates
- **No code without tests**
- **No tests without requirements**
- **No features without specifications**
- **No releases without validation**

### 3. Traceability Requirements
- **Code-to-Spec Mapping**: Every function must reference a requirement
- **Test-to-Spec Mapping**: Every test must validate a requirement
- **Documentation-to-Spec Mapping**: All docs must reflect current specs
- **Change-to-Spec Mapping**: All changes must update relevant specs
