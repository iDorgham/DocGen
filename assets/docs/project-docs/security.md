## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email Security Team

Send an email to **security@docgen.dev** with the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have a suggested fix (optional)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. Disclosure Process

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will coordinate the public disclosure after the fix is released
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Input Validation

DocGen CLI implements comprehensive input validation:

- **YAML Validation**: All YAML files are validated using Pydantic models
- **Path Sanitization**: File paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
- **Template Security**: Template variables are sanitized and validated
- **URL Validation**: URLs are validated to prevent malicious links

### Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning tools:

- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Secure Development

Our development process includes:

- **Code Review**: All code changes are reviewed for security issues
- **Security Testing**: Security tests are included in our test suite
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configurations by default

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of DocGen CLI
2. **Validate Input**: Validate all input data before processing
3. **Secure Templates**: Only use trusted templates
4. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions on generated documents
5. **Network Security**: Use secure networks when downloading templates or data

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Path Validation**: File paths are validated to prevent traversal attacks
- **Template Security**: Secure template rendering with input validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive information

### Security Tools

- **Safety**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security checks before commits
- **CI/CD Security**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Public Disclosure

When we disclose vulnerabilities:

1. **Security Advisory**: We publish a security advisory on GitHub
2. **CVE Assignment**: We work with CVE.org to assign CVE numbers for significant vulnerabilities
3. **Release Notes**: Security fixes are documented in release notes
4. **Communication**: We communicate with users through appropriate channels

### Credit

We credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **Hall of Fame**: Security researchers are listed in our security hall of fame
- **Acknowledgments**: Public acknowledgments in security advisories
- **Bug Bounty**: We may offer bug bounties for significant vulnerabilities
