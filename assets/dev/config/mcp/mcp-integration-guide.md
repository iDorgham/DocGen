## Development Workflow Patterns

### Knowledge-First Development Pattern
```python
# 1. Retrieve relevant knowledge before starting any task
knowledge = retrieve_knowledge("DocGen CLI template management patterns")

# 2. Execute development work with context
implement_feature_with_context(knowledge)

# 3. Store implementation knowledge after completion
store_knowledge("Template consolidation solution: src/templates/ structure")
```

### Automated Testing Pattern
```python
# 1. Bootstrap test environment
bootstrap_tests(port=3000, type="backend", scope="codebase")

# 2. Generate test plans
test_plans = generate_test_plans(frontend=True, backend=True)

# 3. Execute comprehensive tests
test_results = execute_tests(test_plans)

# 4. Run quality audits
quality_results = run_quality_audits()
```

### Browser Automation Pattern
```python
# 1. Navigate to application
navigate_to_app("http://localhost:3000")

# 2. Execute user journeys
execute_user_journey("document_generation_workflow")

# 3. Run quality audits
run_accessibility_audit()
run_performance_audit()
run_best_practices_audit()
```

### Project Management Pattern
```python
# 1. Create project tasks
create_task("Fix template location inconsistency", priority="high")

# 2. Track progress
update_task_progress(task_id, status="in_progress")

# 3. Generate reports
generate_progress_report()
```

## Implementation Scripts

### Enhanced MCP Integration
```bash
# Run comprehensive MCP integration
python assets/dev/scripts/enhanced_mcp_integration.py
```

### MCP Workflow Orchestrator
```bash
# Run complete workflow orchestration
python assets/dev/scripts/mcp_workflow_orchestrator.py
```

### Test Runner
```bash
# Run automated tests with MCP integration
python assets/dev/scripts/run_mcp_tests.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Required
**Issue**: MCP servers require authentication
**Solution**: 
- Byterover: Login through Byterover extension
- TestSprite: Create API key at https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/settings/apikey

#### 2. Test Environment Setup
**Issue**: TestSprite requires project to be running
**Solution**: 
- Start the project on the specified port
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check project configuration

#### 3. Browser Automation Failures
**Issue**: Playwright browser not installed
**Solution**:
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

#### 4. Import Path Issues
**Issue**: Test imports fail with module not found
**Solution**:
```python
# Add src to Python path in test files
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..', '..', '..', 'src'))
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Knowledge Management

- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Run quality audits on every change
- Validate accessibility and performance standards
- Check security vulnerabilities regularly
- Maintain comprehensive documentation

### 4. Project Management
- Create detailed tasks with clear acceptance criteria
