## Emergency Procedures

### If Specifications Are Incomplete
1. **Stop implementation** until specifications are complete
2. **Update specifications** with missing details
3. **Review and approve** updated specifications
4. **Resume implementation** with complete specifications

### If Requirements Change
1. **Document the change** in specifications
2. **Assess impact** on existing implementation
3. **Update implementation plan** if necessary
4. **Communicate changes** to all stakeholders

### If Critical Issues Found
1. **Stop all development** until issues are resolved
2. **Document the issues** and their impact
3. **Create remediation plan** with timeline
4. **Resume development** only after issues are resolved

This checklist ensures that the DocGen CLI project maintains the highest quality standards while staying true to the spec-driven development approach.
