# DocGen CLI Contracts

This directory contains the comprehensive contract specifications for the DocGen CLI project. These contracts define the interfaces, data structures, and behavioral contracts that all components must adhere to.

## Contract Files

### 1. API Contracts (`api_contracts.md`)
Defines the API contracts for the DocGen CLI tool, specifying:
- **Core API Contracts**: Project management, document generation, validation APIs
- **Data Model Contracts**: Project, document, and template model specifications
- **Service Contracts**: File system, template engine, and configuration services
- **CLI Interface Contracts**: Command interface and interactive prompt specifications
- **Error Handling Contracts**: Error response format and exception handling
- **Performance Contracts**: Response time and resource usage requirements
- **Security Contracts**: Input sanitization and data privacy requirements
- **Testing Contracts**: Unit test and integration test specifications
- **Documentation Contracts**: API and user documentation requirements
- **Versioning Contracts**: Semantic versioning and backward compatibility

### 2. Data Contracts (`data_contracts.md`)
Defines the data contracts for the DocGen CLI tool, specifying:
- **Core Data Models**: Project, document, template, and configuration data structures
- **Data Validation Contracts**: Input validation rules and data integrity requirements
- **Data Flow Contracts**: Project creation, document generation, and data migration flows
- **Data Storage Contracts**: File system storage and data serialization
- **Data Security Contracts**: Data encryption and privacy requirements
- **Data Backup and Recovery Contracts**: Backup strategy and recovery procedures
- **Data Quality Contracts**: Quality metrics and monitoring requirements

### 3. Template Contracts (`template_contracts.md`)
Defines the template contracts for the DocGen CLI tool, specifying:
- **Template Structure Contracts**: Template file structure and content requirements
- **Template Rendering Contracts**: Rendering engine and inheritance specifications
- **Template Management Contracts**: Storage, versioning, and validation requirements
- **Template Customization Contracts**: Custom template and configuration specifications
- **Template Performance Contracts**: Rendering performance and optimization requirements
- **Template Testing Contracts**: Test structure and execution specifications

## Contract Compliance

All components of the DocGen CLI must adhere to these contracts. Contract violations must be documented and addressed in subsequent releases. Contracts may be updated through the standard change management process.

## Usage

These contracts serve as:
- **Development Guidelines**: For implementing new features and components
- **Testing Specifications**: For validating contract compliance
- **Documentation Standards**: For maintaining consistent interfaces
- **Quality Assurance**: For ensuring system reliability and consistency

## Contract Validation

Contract compliance is validated through:
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual contract implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Testing contract interactions
- **API Tests**: Validating API contract compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Ensuring performance contract adherence
- **Security Tests**: Validating security contract requirements

## Maintenance

Contracts are maintained through:
- **Version Control**: All contracts are versioned and tracked
- **Change Management**: Contract changes follow formal review process
- **Documentation Updates**: Contract changes are documented
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular contract compliance checks
- **Stakeholder Review**: Contract changes require stakeholder approval
